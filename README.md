# Rock, paper, scissors game
This is my second project following The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).

## Objective
To create a game of rock, paper, scissors. A game consists of five rounds, and a winner is determined for each round. 
The winner of the entire game is based on how many rounds they win.

## What did I learn?
The importance of thinking about the solution prior to doing any coding. This made it much easier to write the code. 

> "Code is there to explain the comments to the computer" - Andy Harris

How to think like a programmer, is a great talk by Andy Harris - www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k

Following the below three steps, I was able to come up with pseudocode for my solution without thinking too much about how to implement that in the code.
### 1. Understand
Understand the problem. What exactly are you trying to do? If you don't understand the problem, how do you know when you have solved it?
### 2. Plan
What inputs and outputs do you have? What steps are required to get from the input to the output? It doesn't matter if the step is big 
(e.g. create graph using data from user) or small (e.g. initialise variable). If the step is required, write it down. It can be broken down into smaller
steps to help you understand.
### 3. Divide and conquer
Pick a step from the algorithm that you created from the planning step and start coding. Don't try to code the whole thing at once. One step at time 
is enough. Test each step works as you implement it.

## What I'm proud of
I'm proud of my comments. Following through and planning out what to do meant I could use the steps from the plan as my comments. No need to go back and try to explain what happened.
